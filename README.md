# **License Plate Recognition System Based on Improved YOLO and OCR**

## **Overview**

This project implements an advanced License Plate Recognition (LPR) system combining YOLOv5 for object detection and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for text extraction. The system also incorporates Transformer-based contextual verification to enhance accuracy and reliability, making it suitable for real-time applications in traffic management and security.

## **Features**

- **High-Precision Detection:** Utilizes YOLOv5 for accurate and fast license plate detection.
- **OCR Integration:** Extracts text from detected license plates using OCR techniques.
- **Transformer-Based Verification:** Applies Transformer models to verify and correct OCR outputs based on contextual information.
- **Scalability:** Designed for deployment on various platforms, including edge devices for real-time operation.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Object Detection Framework:** YOLOv5
- **OCR Library:** Tesseract OCR or similar
- **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **Transformer Models:** Hugging Face Transformers
- **Deployment:** Flask (for web-based interface), Docker (optional for containerization)
- **Version Control:** Git


## **Usage**

1. **Run the application:** Start the system by running the `main.py` file.
2. **Provide input:** The system can process images or video feeds to detect and recognize license plates.
3. **Monitor output:** The recognized license plate text will be displayed along with the contextual verification results.
4. **Save results:** The system can save recognized plates and their corresponding information for further analysis.

## **Dataset**

- The model was trained on a publicly available license plate dataset and supplemented with custom data to improve performance.
- Due to size constraints, the dataset is not included in this repository. Refer to the `data` directory for scripts and instructions on how to prepare your dataset.

## **Results**

- The system demonstrated high accuracy in detecting and recognizing license plates across various conditions, including different lighting and angles.
- Detailed performance metrics, including precision and recall scores, are available in the `results` directory.

## **Contributing**

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request or open an Issue for any suggestions or improvements.
